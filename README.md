# responsive

This was my first website! I learned alot here. An exercise in responsive design, I used basic HTML and CSS to build 
this site as a sort of photo grid that showcases all of my nieces, nephews, and godchildren. 
Each photo leads to an individual profile page.

As you will see, this code is not dry at all. If I had to do it again, I would obviously use functions to switch out the kids as objects instead of creating 9 different html files. This repository is a bit chaotic...which is actually appropriate for this group of spirited children. I keep this as a nostalgic look back at my first website!
